# probabilistic-neural-network

A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is a feedforward neural network, which is widely used in classification and pattern recognition problems.

I would redirect you [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_neural_network) and [here](http://www.personal.reading.ac.uk/~sis01xh/teaching/CY2D2/Pattern3.pdf) for the theory.

Let's get started with the implementation!

A PNN has four layers:
1. Input Layer
2. Pattern (Hidden) Layer
3. Summation Layer
4. Output Layer

### Input Layer

The input layer is your regular feature vector representation of the input.
